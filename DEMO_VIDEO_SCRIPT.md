## üìù Script Breakdown

### **[0:00 - 0:20] Opening Hook & Problem Statement** *(20 seconds)*

**[Screen: Title slide with GKE Turns 10 logo]**

> "Welcome to our GKE Turns 10 Hackathon submission. I'm going to show you how we built an intelligent fraud detection system that acts as an external 'smart brain' for Bank of Anthos, using Google's Agent Developer Kit and Gemini AI."

**[Screen: Bank of Anthos dashboard showing normal transactions]**

> "Traditional fraud detection systems are reactive and often miss sophisticated attacks. Our solution provides real-time, proactive fraud detection with explainable AI decisions."

**Key Talking Points:**
- Emphasize "external" approach - no core banking code changes
- Highlight "real-time" and "explainable AI"
- Set up the problem of traditional fraud detection limitations

---

### **[0:20 - 0:50] Architecture & Technology Showcase** *(30 seconds)*

**[Screen: Architecture diagram showing Bank of Anthos + Fraud Detection System]**

> "Our architecture leverages Google's Agent Developer Kit - the cutting-edge framework for building AI agents. The fraud detection system runs as external microservices on GKE, monitoring Bank of Anthos APIs without any intrusive changes."

**[Screen: Code snippet showing ADK agent implementation]**

> "Here's our ADK agent in action. It uses tool-based reasoning with multiple analysis engines - transaction amount analysis, temporal pattern detection, behavioral deviation analysis, and geospatial risk assessment."

**[Screen: Kubernetes dashboard showing all services running]**

> "Everything deploys seamlessly on GKE with auto-scaling, monitoring, and production-ready configurations."

**Key Talking Points:**
- **ADK Integration**: "Google Agent Developer Kit with tool-based reasoning"
- **External Architecture**: "No changes to core banking services"
- **Production Ready**: "Auto-scaling, monitoring, fault tolerance"
- **Technology Stack**: "FastAPI, Gemini AI, PostgreSQL, Streamlit"

**Visual Cues:**
- Show architecture diagram with clear data flow
- Highlight ADK code with @Tool decorators
- Display Kubernetes pods running successfully

---

### **[0:50 - 1:40] Live Demo - Normal vs Fraudulent Transactions** *(50 seconds)*

**[Screen: Split view - Bank of Anthos on left, Fraud Dashboard on right]**

> "Let me demonstrate with live transactions. First, a normal transaction - Alice buys coffee for $4.50."

**[Action: Execute normal transaction in Bank of Anthos]**
**[Screen: Fraud dashboard shows low risk score 0.12]**

> "Our ADK agent analyzes this in real-time. Risk score: 0.12 - very low risk. The AI explains: 'Normal amount, typical business hours, usual merchant category.'"

**[Screen: Show detailed analysis breakdown]**

> "Now watch what happens with a suspicious transaction - $2,500 electronics purchase in Tokyo at 3:45 AM, when Alice normally transacts in San Francisco."

**[Action: Execute high-risk transaction]**
**[Screen: Fraud dashboard immediately shows high risk score 0.95]**

> "Instant detection! Risk score: 0.95 - critical fraud risk. The ADK agent identified multiple risk factors: unusual location, suspicious timing, high amount deviation, and impossible travel velocity."

**[Screen: Show explainable AI reasoning]**

> "This is explainable AI in action - every decision comes with clear reasoning that compliance teams can understand and act upon."

**Key Talking Points:**
- **Real-time Analysis**: "Instant detection as transactions occur"
- **Explainable AI**: "Clear reasoning for every decision"
- **Risk Scoring**: "0.0 to 1.0 scale with confidence levels"
- **Multiple Factors**: "Amount, timing, location, behavioral patterns"

**Visual Cues:**
- Show real-time updates in dashboard
- Highlight risk score changes
- Display detailed AI reasoning
- Show transaction flow between systems

---

### **[1:40 - 2:20] Advanced Features & Production Readiness** *(40 seconds)*

**[Screen: Fraud dashboard showing multiple transaction types]**

> "Our system handles complex scenarios. Here's rapid-fire ATM withdrawals - the agent detects velocity-based fraud patterns and assigns medium-high risk scores."

**[Action: Show multiple rapid transactions]**
**[Screen: Dashboard showing pattern detection]**

> "The ADK agent uses Model Context Protocol for rich context - user behavior history, merchant intelligence, geolocation data, and known fraud patterns."

**[Screen: Kubernetes monitoring dashboard]**

> "Production features include horizontal pod autoscaling, health checks, persistent storage, and comprehensive monitoring. The system scales automatically under load."

**[Screen: API documentation]**

> "RESTful APIs enable integration with existing fraud management systems, and the Streamlit dashboard provides real-time operational visibility."

**Key Talking Points:**
- **Pattern Detection**: "Velocity-based fraud, behavioral anomalies"
- **Context Enrichment**: "Model Context Protocol for comprehensive analysis"
- **Production Features**: "Auto-scaling, monitoring, fault tolerance"
- **Integration Ready**: "RESTful APIs, webhook support"

**Visual Cues:**
- Show multiple transaction patterns
- Display auto-scaling in action
- Highlight API documentation
- Show monitoring metrics
